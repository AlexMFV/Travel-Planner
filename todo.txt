Urgent features:
- Add Nodemon to the hosted website, this way when a file is changed, the server will restart automatically.

Soon features:
- Inside the add new flight page:
    - Add a button in the middle allowing the user to change "from" and "to" flight
    - Add "duration" field to New Flight page (and also to the stored procedure and methods)
- Inside the list flight page:
    - Add a badge to duration column indicating flight time (green < 4 hours, yellow < 8 hours, red < 12 hours, wine > 12 hours)
    - Add a new column indicating the number of times that flight has been flown
    - Add a new column indicating the last time that flight has been flown (maybe)
    - Add a delete button to each row, this might not be done as it will require a confirmation dialog and probably cause problems if there are records using that flight
- Add Excel link to "Excel Document" sidebar menu
- Sidebar dynamic page highlighting

Later features:
- Allow an option to add non-direct flights (i.e. flights that have a stopover)
- On the home page widgets add a widgets with a countdown to the next 3/5 trips or maybe a list with all trips
- Design Home Page
- Use req.session to allow the server and API to access the values of the logged in user
